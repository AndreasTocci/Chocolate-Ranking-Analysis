# Chocolate-Ranking-Analysis
**Data source** – This Data was collected by chocolate tasting experts known as the ‘Manhattan Chocolate Society’. They are industry experts who taste the chocolates and interview producers and manufacturers about how the chocolate is made. The data was made available through Kaggle.

**Data Set** - flavors_of_cacao.csv

**Data Collection** – This is a form of administrative data; the data is collected by tasting experts and then gathered into a central system. It is updated regularly, with multiple entries every year and ongoing. The data is collected by members of the ‘Manhattan Chocolate Society’ via, personal examination of product and interviews with manufacturers.

**Data Overview** – This data shows Company name, Origin of the bean, Type of bean, Name of bar, Review date, and Country manufactured in. Data ranges from 2006-2017.

**Limitations** – This data is collected Manually thus there is room for human error, then this data needs to not only be collected but needs to be transferred to a digital storage tidied and organized so it may be used. This could create a timelines issue as we don’t know how long it takes after testing to be uploaded into the system. However, we do know that they have multiple updates a year according to the data. This is also tested by humans so undoubtedly there will be some level of personal bias due to everyone’s tastebuds being different flavours appealing to different people.
Only 1 chocolate is tasted out of a batch and not tested again after thus it may unrepresentative as some chocolates after they have been tested might change the recipe for that specific bar and if it is not tested again its previous result is unrepresentative.
